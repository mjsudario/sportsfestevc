(Suggestions/Notes)

1. jersey design as bg

2. ||Sport, Boys/Girls/Mixed, Category, House vs House||
layout? https://ibb.co/9ZJw5W3
with respect to the assigned house, cells will be highlighted with the following legend:
  - gray (upcoming game)
  - yellow (ongoing game)
  - red (lost game) âœŒ
  - green (won game) ðŸ‘Š

3. feedback button/redirectory

4. might need to create 2 calendars/schedules [major, minor, and esports (11 games)] and [junior (11 games)]

5. Image carousel on main page (maybe displays the houses idk)

6. what if we assign people into groups that focus on a specific part of the webpage (html,css,js.adroind compatibility,assets,etc)
  
  * pwede pero feel ko magiging messy kay no css and javascript without html & 
  android compatibility will need css and javascript. pero maybe one group of people who would
  focus on one webpage would be more organized
  
7. House page format:
    - House character (left side) description (right side)
    - Games schedule (Below House character and description) //refer to suggestion 2
    - Insert motivational house charcter chibi gif (Somewhere)

8. Cookies for last selected house on image carousel

9. little (i) icon on words like CAT A, CAT B, and CAT C which prompts the user which batches fall under cat a b and c

10. pages for booths and stalls

11. FREEDOM WALL!!
